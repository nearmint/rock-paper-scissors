In this project, I first created a console-based rock-paper-scissors game (old.html) and later a UI-based one at index.html. As it is set up, the user plays against a computer player who selects his hands at random. It is set up in a way that five rounds are played. Individual results and the final result are logged. 

By completing this project I have demonstrated my current Javascript skills, I have used DOM manipulation, loops, operators, functions and more.
