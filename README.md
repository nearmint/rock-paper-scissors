In this project, I have created a console-based rock-paper-scissors game. As it is set up, the user plays against a computer player who selects his hands at random. It is set up in a way that five rounds are played. The user is asked for his input with a prompt. Individual results and the final result are logged to the console. 

By completing this project I have demonstrated my current Javascript skills, I have used loops, operators, functions and more.
